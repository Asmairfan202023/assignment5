  CSS Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and visual design of a webpage. It allows you to control how HTML elements are displayed on screen, in print, or in other media. CSS works alongside HTML, which provides the structure of the webpage, to specify layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

Here are some key aspects of CSS:

Selectors: CSS applies styles to HTML elements using selectors. For example, you can apply styles to all p elements, or target specific elements using class or ID selectors.

Properties and Values: CSS styles are defined by properties e.g., color, font-size, margin and values. For example:

This CSS rule changes the text color of all  elements to blue and sets the font size to 16 pixels.

Cascading Nature: The "cascading" part of CSS means that styles are applied in order of priority, depending on their specificity (e.g., inline styles, external stylesheets, or browser defaults) and the order in which they appear.

Responsive Design: CSS can also help design webpages that adapt to different screen sizes, using media queries.

By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), CSS makes it easier to maintain and update the visual design of webpages.</p>
