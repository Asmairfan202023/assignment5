        HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a coding language that's used to structure and create content for web pages: 
What it does
HTML tells web browsers how to display content like text, images, headings, and other multimedia. 
How it works
HTML uses tags, or markup codes, to define elements on a web page. For example, a paragraph tag wraps a paragraph, and an image tag embeds an image. 
What it's used for
HTML is primarily used for static websites. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP. 
Features
HTML is platform-agnostic, meaning it can display web pages on any platform. 
Learning
HTML is a good place to start if you want to learn about web development.
